# Andriveau-Bobine

Address-based lookup over historical Paris registers ("bobines"). Given a street name and house number, return the administrative location at the time the register was compiled (`arrondissement`, `quartier`, `ilot`).

## Language

### Source provenance

**Bobine**:
An archival reel of scanned register pages from the Paris archives. Each bobine covers a specific area of the city.
**Identifier in data**: `source_entries.bobine` is the reel number as a **plain integer** only. Other strings that appear on scans or in finding aids (e.g. archival series like `2MI 24`, composite labels) are **audit-only** — they may live in scans, notes, or upstream tooling, but are not modeled as structured columns alongside `bobine`.
_Avoid_: reel, microfilm.

**Page**:
A page within a bobine. Carries the `quartier` and `arrondissement` as page-level metadata in the source.
_Avoid_: sheet, scan.

**Source entry**:
One **logical register row** from the clerk’s table: a single horizontal notation (street + îlot + house numbers) that belongs together, even when the **printed grid** does not fully contain the ink.

- **Street (type + libellé):** in **almost all** cases the handwriting respects the printed **address** cell; line-wrapping stays inside that rectangle (like a spreadsheet cell). Some registers use a **ditto** **`"`** in the address cell alone = **same street line as the row above** (îlot still from the sticky îlot column); see **`data/docs/SOURCE_BOBINE43_GRANDES_CARRIERES_TABLE_MODEL.md`**.
- **NEANT:** a printed row meaning **no housing rows** for that îlot span is **skipped** at extraction — it never becomes a `source_entry` (`docs/LLM_EXTRACTION_INTERCHANGE.md`).
- **Îlot:** usually inside its cell; **rare** overflow when several numbers are listed (e.g. three îlots).
- **House numbers:** may **overflow** the printed cell and **continue downward** across the grid (long lists in the **N°** cell beside **ADRESSE**), so visually the street name looks “sticky” on the left with a tall number block beside it. That whole span is still **one** source entry.

`source_entries.raw_text` is the extraction pipeline’s **single stitched string** for that logical row (LLM + OCR reading across the relevant cells), not one DB row per printed box. No `raw_scanned` column in v1. One source entry can produce multiple `street_segments`.
_Avoid_: row, record, line (ambiguous vs table row vs wrapped line).

### Administrative hierarchy

**Arrondissement**:
Top-level Paris administrative division. Stable across the period covered by the bobines.
**Display name**: French ordinal — `1er` for `1`, `2e`/`3e`/…/`20e` for `2`–`20`. The bobine extraction JSON carries only the integer (`document_scope.arrondissement`); the display name is materialized by the **loader** from a static `{1..20} → name` map, not re-emitted by the extractor.

**Quartier**:
Subdivision of an arrondissement. Page-level metadata in the bobines (the page header names the quartier).

**Îlot**:
Numbered block inside a quartier. **Row-level data** in the bobines: each source entry names its îlot directly. Not derived from anything else.
**Numbering**: globally unique across all 20 arrondissements of Paris, in the integer range `0..5000`. Historical Paris administrative entity, since superseded by INSEE `IRIS` zones (out of scope here). This is an external domain fact, not a property the schema needs to defend; it is the reason `ilots.number` carries a global `UNIQUE` and not a `UNIQUE(quartier_id, number)`.
_Avoid_: block, parcel.

### Address mapping

**Rue**:
A canonical Paris voie. Decomposed into `type` and `libellé` (see below). The table is named `rues` for source fidelity, but it represents **any voie**, regardless of `type`.
_Avoid_: street, voie (as a column or table name; only used informally).

**Type** (of voie):
The canonical classifier of a rue, drawn from the official French voie-type vocabulary (~220 values, e.g. `Rue`, `Avenue`, `Boulevard`, `Place`, `Quai`, `Allée`, `Impasse`, `Passage`, `Square`, `Villa`, `Cité`, `Galerie`, `Pont`, `Esplanade`, `Chemin`, `Sentier`, `Hameau`, `Faubourg`, `Voie`, …). Types are **not always one word**: `Petite Rue`, `Grande Rue`, `Petit Chemin`, `Ancien Chemin`, `Nouvelle Route`, `Centre Commercial`, `Grand Boulevard`, etc. are themselves type values. Stored canonical; abbreviation expansion (`Bd → Boulevard`, `av. → Avenue`, `R. → Rue`) and inference of missing-type rows (`Pierre Lescot` → `Rue Pierre-Lescot`, `ST Denis` → `Rue Saint-Denis`) happen in the extractor.
_Avoid_: kind, category, prefix.

**Libellé**:
The remainder of the rue name after the `type` is removed, in canonical display form. Examples: `de Vaugirard`, `du Cherche-Midi`, `Notre-Dame-des-Champs`, `d'Assas`. Hyphens and apostrophes preserved for display; abbreviations inside the libellé (`St → Saint`, `Ste → Sainte`) are expanded by the extractor.
_Avoid_: name (ambiguous), street name.

**Normalized form**:
The match-time projection of a name. Aggressive rule: lowercase, strip accents (NFD + combining-mark removal), replace `'` and `-` with space, collapse whitespace. Used for both `rues.libelle_normalized` and `quartiers.name_normalized`. Computed by a single shared function; the same rule applies everywhere.
_Avoid_: slug, key.

**Street segment**:
A `(rue, parity, ordered range)` unit. Ranges are **closed** (finite `from`/`to`); **open-ended** house-number spans from the source are **not** modeled — extraction **rejects** them (`docs/EXTRACTION.md` → No-Go Cases). Multiple segments of the same `rue` map to different ilots over different number ranges. Singletons are represented by equal endpoints. **`type_inferred`**: when `true`, the voie type was inferred by the extractor because the source line had no explicit type token; stored on `street_segments` for QA filters. **`quality_flags`**: integer bitmask for extraction/QA signals (e.g. low-confidence pipeline output); see `apps/api/src/lib/quality_flags.ts`. Strikethroughs and similar source corrections are **not** modeled here — they are skipped at extraction. Multiple îlots on one segment (`segment_ilots`) are **normal** source state, not a quality flag.

**Parity**:
Strictly `odd` or `even`. Range endpoints share parity; singletons inherit from the number. Never `both`.

**Suffix**:
Ordered sub-position on the house-number axis: none `0`, `bis 1`, `ter 2`, `quater 3`, `quinquies 4`, `sexies 5`, `septies 6`. Tokens beyond `septies` are **not** modeled; if they appear in a source, extraction **skips and logs** (same policy as other unsupported notations). Single source of truth in `packages/lookup` (`suffix-rank.ts`: `SUFFIX_RANK`, `rankOfSuffix`, `suffixOfRank`).

## Relationships

- An **Arrondissement** has many **Quartiers**.
- A **Quartier** has many **Îlots**.
- A **Rue** is composed of a **Type** + a **Libellé**, and is uniquely identified by `(type, libellé_normalized)`.
- A **Source entry** can produce many **Street segments** (one per `(rue, parity, range)` produced from that logical row’s notation).
- A **Street segment** can map to several **Îlots** within the same quartier.
- A **Bobine page** carries the **Quartier** as header metadata; each row carries an **Îlot**, a **Rue**, and one or more number ranges.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "If I see `Bd Raspail 95` on a page, what gets written?"
> **Domain expert:** "One **Source entry** with `raw_text` for that register row reading `Bd Raspail 95`. The extractor parses it: **Type** = `Boulevard`, **Libellé** = `Raspail`, **Libellé_normalized** = `raspail`. We look up or create a **Rue** with `(type='Boulevard', libellé_normalized='raspail')`. Then a **Street segment** with `from=to=95`, `parity='odd'`. The page header tells us this is in the **Quartier** `Notre-Dame-des-Champs`, **Arrondissement** 6. The row's **Îlot** column gives us which **Îlot** to link via `segment_ilots`."
>
> **Dev:** "What if the same page later has `Boulevard Raspail 97`?"
> **Domain expert:** "Same **Rue**, because `(Boulevard, raspail)` is the unique key. New **Source entry** (different `raw_text`), new **Street segment**."

**Conflict** (lookup-time):
A response is in conflict when the matched ilots come from **more than one `source_entry`** for the same `(rue, n, parity)` input. A single source entry asserting multiple ilots via `segment_ilots` (shared edge / correction) is **not** a conflict — it's a legitimate intent of the source. The API computes this at query time; no schema column carries it.
_Avoid_: ambiguous, mismatch.

## Flagged ambiguities

- **"Rue" is overloaded.** It means both (a) the table name for all voies, regardless of type, and (b) one specific `type` value. Resolution: the table `rues` covers all voies; the column `type` carries the kind. When a domain expert says "rue", treat it as (a) unless context narrows it.
- **"Adresse" in the source.** The bobine's `ADRESSE` column header refers to the rue name only, not the full address. Number ranges live in the `N°` column. We've split this into `rues` + `street_segments` and never use "adresse" as a domain term.
- **"Faubourg", "Petite", "Grande", … are context-dependent.** They can appear _inside a libellé_ (`Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré` → `type='Rue'`, `libellé='du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré'`) OR as _part of a multi-word type_ (`Petite Rue de la Truanderie` → `type='Petite Rue'`, `libellé='de la Truanderie'`; `Faubourg Saint-Antoine` without a preceding `Rue` → `type='Faubourg'`, `libellé='Saint-Antoine'`). Resolution requires a longest-match against the official voie-type list — not a "first-token" rule.
